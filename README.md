The exercise is to create a Java/JavaScript project (or projects) in Eclipse/Intellij, add Cucumber and any other add-ins you might need.   

 
 
 

Develop the following three tests: 

A person with the following details:  

Single,  

0 dependants,  

buying a home to live in,  

with income of $80,000,  

other income $10,000,  

living expenses $500,  

current home loan repayments $0, 

other loan repayments $100,  

other commitments $0  

and total credit card limits $10,000  

has a borrowing estimate of $479,000. 

Clicking the ‘start over’ button clears the form. 

Entering only $1 for Living expenses, and leaving all other fields as zero, clicking ‘Work out how much I could borrow’ returns the following message: 
“Based on the details you've entered, we're unable to give you an estimate of your borrowing power with this calculator. For questions, call us on 1800 100 641.”
